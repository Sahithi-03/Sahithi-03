## Hi there, I’m Sahithi 👋

Recent Computer Science graduate with experience across **machine learning, applied research, and full-stack ML systems**. My academic and project work spans research-oriented studies, credit-heavy capstone projects, and applied industry work, with a strong focus on understanding **model behavior, data constraints, and real-world feasibility**.

I’m interested in building systems where **AI is not just functional, but understandable, scalable, and responsible**.

### 🔍 What I’ve Worked On
- Research-oriented projects involving literature review, conceptual framework design, and feasibility analysis  
- A graded academic capstone on **solar flare prediction** using deep learning and exploratory graph-based modeling  
- An applied machine learning internship project delivering a **frontend–backend system** for Type-2 diabetes prediction  
- Academic and applied projects completed as part of **CS50 Python, Web Programming, and SQL**, including final projects  

Detailed descriptions and documentation are available in the respective repositories.
